I am currently a Researcher at **Huawei 2012 Labs, Darwin Research Center** in London, UK.

I obtained my Ph.D. in 2025 from **Queen's University Belfast (QUB)**, UK, under the supervision of Dr. [Yang Hua](https://yanghuadr.github.io), Dr. Sean McLoone, and Dr. Hui Wang. My Ph.D. research was fully funded by the DfE scholarship. Prior to that, I received my Master’s (2020) and Bachelor's (2017) degrees from the **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)**, advised by Prof. Jun Yu.

With over eight years of experience in computer vision and machine learning, my research bridges fundamental problems with real-world applications. I have a particular focus on:

* **Generative Models** (GAN and Diffusion Models, etc.)
* **Data-Efficient Learning**
* **Reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs)**
* **Efficient Hardware Design**
